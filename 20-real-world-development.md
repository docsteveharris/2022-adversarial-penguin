# Real World Development

Real-world data (RW-Data) means the use of observational data at scale augmented by linking across multiple data sources to generate insights simply not available from isolated controlled clinical trials.[@corrigan-curay2018a] The FDA uses data from tens of millions of patients in its [Sentinel programme](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org) to monitor drug safety, and the [OpenSafely](https://www.opensafely.org) programme in the UK generated impactful insights into COVID-19 within the first few months of the global pandemic.[@williamson2020] 

Given the sensitive nature of health data, these initiatives depend on expanding investment into TREs. [@2021c] TREs are an example of 'data-to-modeler' (DTM) designs where data flows from source (primary, secondary, social care and elsewhere) to a separate, secure landing zone. Here research teams write the code to link, clean and analyse the data. Derived insights eventually return to the bedside through clinical guidelines and policy. To date, DTM is also the dominant design pattern in ML4H but this approach is fundamentally flawed.

It is flawed because it imposes a separation between the modeller and the end-user. ML4H is not concerned with better guidelines or policy but with better operational and clinical decision making. This requires the practitioner to work alongside the end-user because excellent offline model performance provides no guarantee of bedside efficacy. Algorithms with inferior technical performance may even provide greater bedside utility.[@the2021; @shah2019] An inverted 'modeler-to-data' (MTD) paradigm was initially proposed to reduce privacy concerns (data are no longer copied and shared but analysed in situ[@guinney2018]), but we see important additional value in that it forces 'real-world development' (RW-Dev) and enables the end-user to work with the modeler in rapid-cycle build-test-learn loops. This first pillar of the CDE is the equivalent of an *internal* TRE *within* the healthcare institution.[@guinney2018] 

RW-Dev has four functional sub-requirements that distinguish it from a TRE. (1) Firstly, data updates must match the cadence of clinical decision making. For most inpatient and acute care pathways, decisions are in real-time (minutes or hours) at the bedside or in the clinic. (2) Secondly, development using live data must be sandboxed and so the clinical system responsible for care delivery is protected (3) Thirdly, privacy must be managed such that teams are able to develop end-user applications that inevitably display patient identifiable information (PII) alongside the model outputs: an anonymous prediction is of little use to a clinician. (4) Fourthly, attention must be paid to developer ergonomics. Where development and deployment steps are separated physically (the TRE paradigm) or functionally (via different languages and technologies), ownership is often split between two different teams. One team prepares the raw data and develops the model, and another prepares the live data and deploys the model. We argue instead that the same team should be able develop *and* deploy. This should accelerate iteratation, reduce cost and increase quality.[@2022b]

We illustrate this idea with a description of our local real-world development platform in \href{fig:1}{Figure 1}, and provide an extended description in the Electronic Supplementary Material.
