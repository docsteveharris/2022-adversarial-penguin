# Real World Development

Real-world data (RW-Data) means the use of observational data at scale augmented by linking across multiple data sources to generate insights simply not available from isolated controlled clinical trials.[@corrigan-curay2018a] The FDA uses data from tens of millions of patients in its [Sentinel programme](https://www.sentinelinitiative.org) to monitor drug safety, and the [OpenSafely](https://www.opensafely.org) programme in the UK generated impactful insights into COVID-19 within the first few months of the global pandemic.[@williamson2020] 

Given the sensitive nature of health data, these initiatives depend on expanding investment into Trusted Research Environments (TRE). [@2021c] Data flows from source (primary, secondary, social care and elsewhere) to a single secure landing zone where research teams write the code to link, clean and analyse the data. The insights return to the bedside through clinical guidelines and policy. This offline '_data-to-code_' approach is also the dominant design pattern in ML4H projects but is fundamentally flawed.

A data-to-code feedback loop is measured in weeks and months, but ML4H interventions are virtual not physical, and must act by altering the behaviour of clinicians by providing insights for better decisions. As such, perfect information provided to the wrong person, or at the wrong moment, cannot be impactful. Excellent offline model performance provides no guarantee of bedside efficacy. Algorithms with inferior technical performance may even provide greater bedside utility.[@the2021; @shah2019] 

ML4H requires instead a 'code-to-data' paradigm, and the first pillar of the CDE is the equivalent of an *internal* TRE *within* the healthcare institution rather than separate and external.[@guinney2018] This permits live Real World Development (RW-Dev) that includes the end-user in rapid-cycle build-test-learn loops.

RW-Dev has four functional sub-requirements that distinguish it from a TRE. (1) Firstly, data updates must match the cadence of clinical decision making. For most inpatient and acute care pathways, decisions are in real-time (minutes or hours) at the bedside or in the clinic. (2) Secondly, experimental work on live data must be sandboxed and unable to harm the live clinical system (3) Thirdly, privacy must be managed such that teams are able to develop end-user applications that inevitably display patient identifiable information (PII) alongside the model outputs: an anonymous prediction is of little use to a clinician. (4) Fourthly, attention must be paid to developer ergonomics. Whether development and deployment are separated physically (the TRE paradigm) or functionally (languages and technologies), responsibilities divide between different teams. One team prepares the raw data and develops the model, and another prepares the live data and deploys the model. Ideally, the same team should be able develop and deploy both by bringing the CDE within the hospital, and secondly by aligning technology. This should accelerate iteratation, reduce cost and increase quality.[@2022b]

We illustrate this idea with a description of our local real-world development platform in \href{fig:1}{Figure 1}, and provide an extended description in the Electronic Supplementary Material.
