Even this analogy stops short of the full task of deployment. With drug development, the universities and the pharmaceutical industry go on to take advantage of a supply chain to deliver the drug to the hospital with the necessary quality control and monitoring. Those prescribing and administering the drug have spent years in training, and are supported by pharmacists and medication safety experts. And even after the drug is administered, observation and long term follow-up continue to identify side-effects and long term hazards.

That network of expertise and infrastructure is largely in place where software _is_ (not as) a medical device, but is only just being envisioned where the data driving ML4H comes from the EHR. This distinction needs to be made else the disillusionment with the promise of ML4H will continue. The technology does have the potential to change how we deliver health but the methodology alone is insufficient. The impressive demonstrations of the power of AI and ML to beat humans in games, and predict protein structures does not mean that these tools are ready for wide spread deployment. 

But we should not be pessimistic. As per author William Gibson, it is clear that "The Future Has Arrived — It’s Just Not Evenly Distributed." Beyond healthcare, machine learning has already demonstrated that it can reliably create value.[@mcrae2015] It is now our responsibility to take those lessons and adapt them for our patients.

The Five Pillars outlined here are a sketch of that redistribution. They are born from our local experience (Pillars 1, 2 and 5) and our wider observations (Pillars 3 and 4). They fundamentally are an argument for a professionalisation of ML4H, and a caution against the 'get-rich quick' headlines in the popular and scientific press.[@bunz2022a] We envision a future where each algorithm is managed in a digital pharmacy with the same rigour that we apply to medicines. But unlike drugs, some of these algorithms will have their entire lifecycle, from development to deployment, managed by the local healthcare provider. Computer vision tasks that support diagnostic radiology can be partially developed offline. Components of sepsis prediction tools will transfer from institution to institution but will need adapting to local clinical workflows. But there will be opportunity and value for ML4H to optimise operational tasks that are temporary or specific to that institution. This means that some development and much of the deployment will require a suitably trained workforce, and an infrastructure perhaps supported by these five pillars.
