We have described a template for a Clinical Deployment Environment that supports the translation of ML4H algorithms from bench to bedside. Although the requirements differ, the objective is similar to that for drug development. A similar approach to phasing has previously been proposed for (biomarker) prediction models.[@pepe2001]

Most ML4H that derives value from the EHR is in the pre-clinical phase. In drug development, the objective of this phase is to identify candidate molecules which might make effective drugs. Evaluation is conducted in vitro. Metrics used to evaluate candidates, such binding affinity or other pharmacokinetic properties, describe the properties of the molecule.[@lo2018] For ML, the objective is to identify candidate algorithms, comprising of input variables and model structures, which might make the core of an effective CDSS. Evaluation is conducted offline on de-identified datasets. Metrics used to evaluate candidates, such Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUROC), the F1 score and calibration, describe the properties of the algorithm.[@collins2015]

Phase 1 drug trials are the first time a drug candidate is tested in humans. They are conducted in small numbers of healthy volunteers. The aim of the trial is to determine the feasibility of progressing to trials in patients by determining drug safety and appropriate dosage. Drug formulation, the processes by which substances are combined with the active pharmaceutical ingredient to optimize the acceptability and effective delivery of the drug, is also considered at this stage. Phase 1 ML4H trials are the first time an algorithm candidate is tested within the healthcare environment. The aim of the trial is to determine the feasibility of progressing to trials of efficacy by ensuring the algorithm implementation is safe, reliable and able to cope with real-world data quality issues. The development of a mechanism to deliver of algorithm outputs embedded in the clinical workflow is also be considered at this stage.

Phase 2 drug trials involve recruitment of small numbers patients with the disease of interest, typically 50 – 200. The aim is to determine drug efficacy at treating the disease. Treating clinicians are involved in so far as they must agree to prescribe the drug for their patients. The trials are often too short to determine long term outcomes, therefore surrogate measures such biomarker status or change in tumour size are used as endpoints.[@vannorman2019]  Phase 2 ML4H trials involve recruitment of small numbers of clinicians making the decision of interest, typically 5 – 10. The aim is to determine the efficacy of the algorithm in improving their decisions. Patients are involved in so far as they must agree to be on the receiving end of these supported decisions and identifiable data is required. Endpoints are markers of successful task completion in all cases. Investigations to determine ways in which the system could be more successful in influencing user behavior are carried out at this stage. These include usability analyses, considerations of how well the ML4H/CDSS is integrated into the overall system and implementation studies to identify how best to optimize end-user adoption and engagement.[@sutton2020]

Phase 3 drug trials involve the recruitment of large numbers of patients to determine whether a drug is effective in improving patient outcomes. The gold standard of trial design is a double-blinded randomized controlled trial (RCT). Phase 3 ML4H trials will require integration of data from multiple centers for algorithms acting on specific decisions but inevitably adapted to their local data environment.

The phases of drug development are not meant to be matched 1:1 to the pillars of the CDE described here: in fact, our argument for 'real-world' _development_ deliberately seeks to merge the steps. But the parallel is drawn to highlight the effort necessary to see ML4H have an impact on the clinical and operational decision making in the workplace. Heretofore this effort has been hugely underestimated.
